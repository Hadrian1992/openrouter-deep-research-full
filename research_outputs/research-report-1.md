## Sub-Query 1 Results:  
**Question:** What is the officially recognized capital city of France, according to French government or EU official sources?

### Consensus Across Models:
- **Both models agree that Paris is the official capital of France.**
- Confirmed by **European Union official country profile** ([European Union — https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/france_en]) and **French government’s Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs** ([French Foreign Ministry — https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/]).  

### Contradictions:
- **Model 1 (openai/gpt-5-mini):** Said Paris is listed on official government and EU sites, but noted the French Constitution might **not** explicitly state Paris as capital. 
- **Model 2 (qwen3-30b):** Claimed that Article 1 of the 1958 Constitution explicitly says “the capital is Paris.”  
  ⚠️ This is **incorrect** — Article 1 of the French Constitution makes no mention of the capital. The Constitution of the Fifth Republic *does not* explicitly designate Paris as capital ([Legifrance: Constitution text — https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/droit-francais/constitution]).  
  Thus, Model 1 is correct here.

### Unique Contributions:
- Model 1 emphasizes Paris’s role as de facto capital by being the seat of the Presidency, Prime Minister, National Assembly, Senate.  
- Model 2 incorrectly attributes constitutional language but correctly notes recognition by international law, treaties, and EU profiles.  

### Sub-Query 1 Synthesis:
✅ **Paris is officially recognized as the capital of France, confirmed by the EU and French government websites.**  
⚠️ The French Constitution does **not** explicitly contain a clause naming Paris as the capital, contrary to Model 2’s claim.  
➡ Confidence: **Very High**

## Sub-Query 2 Results:  
**Question:** Are there any historical or legal nuances regarding Paris’s designation as capital?  

### Consensus Across Models:
- Both models agree Paris has been the de facto capital since the **Capetian dynasty (10th century)**.  
- During crises, the seat of government sometimes relocated temporarily (e.g., **Bourges, Chinon, Versailles, Bordeaux, Vichy, Algiers**), but Paris remained the long-term and recognized political capital.  
- No modern French constitution or law has ever moved or altered that status.  

### Contradictions:
- No outright contradictions. Both agree Versailles (1682–1789 under Louis XIV) and WWII relocations were *temporary functional seat changes*, not legal transfers of capital.  
- Model 1 places more emphasis on Versailles and WWII (Vichy, Algiers), while Model 2 highlights broader medieval through Revolution continuity and temporary war relocations.

### Unique Contributions:
- Model 1: Specific references to **Charles VII’s court in Bourges/Chinon** and **Vichy & Algiers during WWII** [Britannica sources].  
- Model 2: Emphasizes that **Versailles was never legally declared the capital** and strengthens the claim that Paris has never been *formally* dethroned as capital [Versailles.fr; Assemblée Nationale site].  

### Sub-Query 2 Synthesis:
✅ **Paris has been the functional and symbolic capital since the 10th century. Temporary relocations occurred during wars or royal strategies (Versailles, Bordeaux, Vichy, Algiers, etc.), but these were exceptions and never formal legal changes.**  
➡ Confidence: **High**, since supported by both historical and constitutional/legal consensus.

## Integrated Answer to the Original Query:

**The capital of France is Paris.**  
This is explicitly affirmed by the European Union ([EU Country Profile — https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/france_en]) and the French government ([Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs — https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/]).  

- The **French Constitution of 1958 does not explicitly state Paris as the capital**, but it is universally recognized in French law, diplomacy, and administration as such. All central institutions — Presidency (Élysée Palace), Prime Minister’s Office (Matignon), Parliament (Assemblée Nationale, Sénat) — are based in Paris ([Government of France — https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/]).  

- **Historical nuance:** While Paris has been the capital since the Capetian kings (10th century), rulers occasionally relocated the court or government seat — e.g., **Bourges/Chinon during the Hundred Years’ War, Versailles under Louis XIV, Bordeaux and Tours during WWI/WWII, Vichy (1940–44), and Algiers (Free France)**. These were **temporary relocations of the seat of government**, not legal changes to the capital ([Britannica: Palace of Versailles, Vichy France — https://www.britannica.com/place/Vichy-France]; [Assemblée Nationale — https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/]).  

- **Modern consensus:** Since the Revolution and throughout the Republics, no official legal act or constitutional amendment has moved the capital anywhere else. Paris retains symbolic, administrative, and international recognition as capital.

## Final Confidence Assessment:
- **Claim: Paris is capital of France — Very High confidence** (multiple authoritative sources).  
- **Claim: Explicit constitutional mention — Incorrect. High confidence that Constitution omits this.**  
- **Claim: Temporary historical relocations — High confidence, documented in both historical and government records.**

---

✅ **Final Answer:**  
Paris is the capital of France. This status is confirmed by official French government and EU sources. While the Constitution does not explicitly name Paris as the capital, it functions as such in all governmental, legal, and diplomatic contexts. Historically, the seat of government was briefly relocated during wars or under monarchs (e.g., Versailles, Bordeaux, Vichy, Algiers), but Paris’s role as the capital has never been legally displaced.

Would you like me to **fact-check the French Constitution directly on Legifrance** to quote whether the word “capital” appears at all, to fully close the loop on the constitutional nuance?
