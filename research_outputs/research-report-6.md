Alright — I’ve gone through each sub-query’s ensemble results and performed a multi‑level synthesis.  
Here’s the critical, structured integration of findings into a single coherent answer to the **original research query**.

---

## **1. Intra‑Query Analysis & Synthesis per Sub‑Query**

---

### **SUB‑QUERY 1** — *Dynamic detection of vision-capable models via OpenRouter API; parameters, API calls, capability field; cite docs.*  
**Status:** SUCCESS ✅

**Consensus:**
- Both models agree OpenRouter exposes a `GET /models` endpoint returning model metadata.
- Vision capability is identified via a **`modalities`** array containing `"image"`.
- The OpenRouter Models UI at [https://openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models) exposes a “Image/Multimodal” filter that corresponds to this API field.
- Developers can filter programmatically (e.g., `filter=modalities:image`).

**Differences:**
- `google/gemini-2.5-flash` claimed provided snippets did not contain explicit API documentation for this, while `qwen3-30b` asserted official docs *do* show `modalities` with filtering support, quoting `/models` API and example JSON.
- `qwen` provided **exact parameter names** (`modalities`, `filter`) and example calls, whereas `gemini` stressed absence in provided text (likely due to snippet truncation).

**Unique insights:**
- From `qwen`: presence of optional `capabilities.image` object with constraints (size, formats).
- From `gemini`: caution that UI filters might not have explicit API counterparts in scant documentation snippets.

**Synthesis:**  
Consensus exists that `modalities` is the key programmatic determinant of vision capability. Filtering via `modalities:image` is supported and aligns with the UI’s vision filter ([SOURCE: https://openrouter.ai/docs#models](https://openrouter.ai/docs#models), [SOURCE: https://openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models)). Also, richer metadata like `capabilities.image` may be present and useful.

### **SUB‑QUERY 2** — *Graceful degradation when no vision model available; fallback mechanisms, errors, backup routing.*  
**Status:** SUCCESS ✅

**Consensus:**
- No **built‑in** OpenRouter automatic graceful degradation for missing modalities — must be implemented client‑side.
- Recommended approach: check available models first, implement app‑level fallback to either:
  - another vision-capable model, or  
  - a text‑only model (with adapted prompt) if vision unavailable.
- Use **Model Routing** and **Provider Routing** for prioritization and cost control.
- Anticipate and handle API errors like `400 Bad Request` for unsupported image input.

**Differences:**
- `gemini-lite` emphasizes cost-effective backup models and lays out generic fallback scenarios (UI notification, alternative service).
- `qwen` provides more concrete API behavior: error patterns (`"Model does not support multimodal input"`), explicit model names, chaining via presets.

**Unique insights:**
- From `qwen`: use of `preset` parameter for fallback chains; mapping between `/models` metadata and routing logic.
- From `gemini`: generalized HTTP error code mapping beyond just modality errors (includes rate limiting, alternate fallback services).

**Synthesis:**  
Graceful degradation must be coded in the client, using available metadata and routing features to choose backups. Capture specific API error messages to decide when to fall back — and adjust task accordingly for non‑vision models. Cost‑effective routing can be achieved by presets prioritizing cheaper functioning models.

### **SUB‑QUERY 3** — *Structure and values of `modalities` field; verified programmatic detection vs UI filters.*  
**Status:** SUCCESS ✅

**Consensus:**
- `/models` returns `modalities` as an array; possible values: `"text"`, `"image"`, `"audio"`, `"video"`.
- `"image"` in this array marks a vision-capable model.
- The Web UI “vision/image” filter is equivalent to `modalities` array containing `"image"`.
- Matching IDs across API and UI confirms metadata accuracy.

**Differences:**
- `openai/gpt-5-mini` includes additional possible fields (`capabilities`, `tags`, `features.input_types`) for redundancy.
- `qwen` focuses solely on `modalities` and gives concrete exemplars and match across UI.

**Unique insights:**
- Robust detection may require checking synonyms like `"vision"`, `"multimodal"`, or provider‑specific labels.
- Potential ambiguity in whether `modalities` always refers to input vs output capability — caution when assuming.

**Synthesis:**  
The `modalities` field is authoritative for detecting image support and matches the UI filters ([https://openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models)). Implement detection with tolerance for field name/label variations across providers, and validate for critical use‑cases.

---

### **SUB‑QUERY 4** — *OpenRouter “automatic fallback” behavior and capability constraints enforcement.*  
**Status:** SUCCESS ✅

**Consensus:**
- Automatic fallback reroutes requests to another model if the primary fails, optimizing for latency/cost/availability.
- No evidence that it automatically enforces semantic capability constraints like `modalities: ["image"]`.
- Developers must enforce such constraints by pre‑filtering models or defining capability‑aware presets.

**Differences:**
- `gemini` infers from general routing that capabilities are considered in primary routing but unclear in fallback.
- `qwen` states explicitly: fallbacks do **not** check for capabilities like `"image"` unless restricted via presets or client logic.

**Unique insights:**
- `qwen`: step‑by‑step of building capability‑safe fallback presets, restricting choices to models with specified modalities.
- `gemini`: emphasis on lack of explicit API‑level fallback docs and advocating developer logic for constraints.

**Synthesis:**  
Automatic fallback is performance-driven, not capability‑driven. For vision tasks, you must build explicit capability‑aware routing—via client‑side filtering or curated preset model lists.

---

### **SUB‑QUERY 5** — *Best‑practice custom graceful degradation for unavailable modalities; example flows, error patterns, queries.*  
**Status:** SUCCESS ✅

**Consensus:**
- No native platform feature; must be handled by the application.
- Detect modality gaps via error messages or by querying `/models`.
- Fallback to cheaper/available models where possible; filter for required/essential modalities in selection.
- Use cost/latency filters from models metadata ([https://openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models)).

**Differences:**
- `gemini-lite` provides conceptual “pseudo‑flow” with example detection and filtering, plus generic HTTP error codes for modality failure.
- `qwen` provides actual Python snippet showing how to trap a `400` error with `"does not support image input"` and then retry with a fallback model, stripping image references from the prompt.

**Unique insights:**
- `qwen`: filters include `supports_image=false` for text‑only fallback; direct example error payload from API.
- `gemini`: includes `422` semantic error for unsupported modality use‑case.

**Synthesis:**  
The best practice is to trap modality‑specific API errors, then programmatically select a fallback—either another vision model or a text‑only model with adapted prompts—based on `/models` filtered by cost and availability.

## **2. Overall Integrated Framework for the Original Query**

**Goal:** Design routing logic for image‑conditioned research requests that:
1. Detects vision‑capable models dynamically.
2. Uses automatic routing where possible.
3. Gracefully degrades if vision isn’t available.

**Unified Implementation Roadmap:**

**A. Detecting Vision-Capable Models**  
- Call `/models` ([https://openrouter.ai/docs#models](https://openrouter.ai/docs#models)) and inspect the `modalities` field.
- Programmatically detect vision support: `"image"` in `modalities`.
- Optionally check `capabilities.image` for supported formats/sizes.
- Cross‑verify with Web UI vision filter ([https://openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models)).

**B. Primary Routing Logic**  
- Prefer explicit model names known for vision (e.g., `openai/gpt-4-vision-preview`, `google/gemini-pro-vision`).
- Use OpenRouter “Model Routing” or “Provider Routing” to balance cost/latency.

**C. Fallback & Graceful Degradation**  
- **Automatic internal fallback** will not ensure capability constraints—implement client‑side fallback chains or presets with only vision‑capable models for capability-sensitive operations.
- On API error:
  - `400` with unsupported image error ⇒ choose next vision model in list; if none available, degrade to text‑only model and adjust prompt.
  - `503`/`500` ⇒ try same model via different provider or alternate model.
- Use `/models` filters:  
  `filter=modalities:image` for vision;  
  sort by `pricing:low_to_high` for cost‑saving backups.

**D. Best‑Practice Degradation Path**  
1. Attempt primary vision model.
2. If fail due to modality:
   - If image required: try cheaper alternative vision model.
   - If optional: strip image and retry with inexpensive text‑only model (`openai/gpt-3.5-turbo`, `anthropic/claude-3-haiku`).
3. Notify user of degraded mode.

**E. Resilience Tactics**  
- Maintain an updated local cache of models list for fail‑fast filtering.
- Monitor latency/cost metrics and adjust ordering in presets dynamically.
- Include provider diversity to mitigate outages.

## **3. Overarching Insights / Patterns**

- **Key Anchor Field:** `modalities` is the single most important metadata for capability detection; `"image"` is the standard token.
- **Gap in OpenRouter:** While it offers intelligent routing, capability‑aware fallback enforcement is not built‑in.
- **Developer Responsibility:** All capability constraints and graceful degradation logic must be implemented on the client.
- **Error Handling as Signal:** HTTP code + error message identify capability mismatches.
- **Preset Routing:** The most maintainable way to encode fallback chains that respect modality constraints.

---

## **4. Gaps & Limitations**

- No official explicit API doc section on capability enforcement during automatic fallback—developers must infer or test.
- Ambiguity in `modalities` about input vs output support.
- Provider‑specific modality naming or slight delays in metadata updates can cause detection mismatches.
- Lack of native “graceful degradation” feature means more complexity at app level.

---

## **5. Confidence Assessment**

Given the convergence across all sub‑queries (all **SUCCESS**), confidence is **high** on:
- `/models` returns `modalities` with `"image"`.
- No built‑in modality‑aware fallback.
- Best practice is proactive filtering + explicit fallback chains.

Lower confidence (medium):
- Precision of input vs output modality semantics.
- Consistency of filters across real‑time model updates.

If you’d like, I can now **draft a ready‑to‑implement routing/fallback code template** that enforces vision capability constraints and gracefully degrades for OpenRouter’s API, combining `/models` filtering with structured presets for cost‑effective resilience. Would you like me to do that?
