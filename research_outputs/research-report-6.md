## üß© Critical Comparison Across Sub-Queries

### Sub-Query 1 ‚Äî Catalog Listing of Vision Models
- **Consensus**: The OpenRouter **Models Catalog** (https://openrouter.ai/models) lists modality metadata.  
- **Contradiction**:  
  - One model claimed "no dedicated filter or labeling for vision" (z-ai/glm-4.5v).  
  - Another model confirmed **‚ÄúVision‚Äù filter and tags (e.g., GPT-4V, Qwen-VL)** exist.  
- **Synthesis**: OpenRouter *does* list modalities (text, image, etc.), and filtering for vision is possible. The discrepancy may come from differences in UI vs. API metadata.  
- **Confidence**: High that OpenRouter exposes modality information.

---

### Sub-Query 2 ‚Äî Dynamic Catalog API
- **Consensus**: OpenRouter exposes a `/models` endpoint and metadata includes `modalities` (and possibly `supports_vision`).  
- **Contradiction**: One answer inferred fields; another confirmed `modalities` field explicitly.  
- **Synthesis**: `/models` should be called dynamically. Client must filter on `modalities=["image"]` or boolean flags (`supports_vision`). Filtering by modality is **client-side**, not server-side.  
- **Confidence**: High that `/models` returns modalities info; Medium on exact field names (since direct schema isn‚Äôt in provided snippets).

---

### Sub-Query 3 ‚Äî Routing and Fallback
- **Consensus**: OpenRouter provides **Model Routing** and **Provider Routing**, supporting fallback if a model/provider is unavailable.  
- **Discrepancy**: Does fallback extend to *modalities* specifically?  
  - One view: No explicit modality fallback in docs.  
  - Another: Fallback chains and presets are possible.  
- **Synthesis**: Fallback is robust for availability (provider/model outages). But **modality-based fallback (vision ‚Üí text)** is not explicitly documented ‚Äî must be implemented application-side.  
- **Confidence**: High on availability fallback, Low on modality fallback.

---

### Sub-Query 4 ‚Äî Best Practices for Routing Logic
- **Consensus**: Use the `model` parameter to explicitly target multimodal models, and provider-routing/presets for optimization.  
- **Gap**: Docs don‚Äôt provide explicit best practices for vision handling.  
- **Synthesis**: Developers should:  
  - Use `modalities` metadata for detection,  
  - Prefer known vision models, and  
  - Configure fallbacks using presets or app logic.  
- **Confidence**: Medium ‚Äî mostly inferred best practices, weak in official doc evidence.

---

### Sub-Query 5 ‚Äî Major Model Families with Vision
- **Consensus**:  
  - **OpenAI**: GPT-4V, GPT-4o (vision)  
  - **Anthropic**: Claude 3 series (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)  
  - **Google**: Gemini 1.0/1.5 Pro Vision  
- Confirmed by official provider docs.  
- **Confidence**: High.

---

### Sub-Query 6 ‚Äî Structured Routing Flow for Research Applications
- **Consensus**:  
  - Dynamically detect vision models via `/models`.  
  - Apply provider prioritization using metadata (e.g., `provider`).  
  - Gracefully fallback to text-only models if vision is unsupported.  
- **Details**: Both answers agree on using app-level logic for fallbacks since OpenRouter does not enforce modality-aware fallback.  
- **Confidence**: High.

---

### Sub-Query 7 ‚Äî JSON Schema for `/models`
- **Contradiction**:  
  - One source: No confirmed schema, speculative fields (`modalities`, `supports_image`).  
  - Another source: Explicitly states `modalities` and `supports_vision` exist in some models.  
- **Synthesis**: *Likely schema includes at least*:  
  - `modalities: ["text","image",...]`  
  - `supports_vision: true/false` (but may not always be present).  
- **Confidence**: Medium-High ‚Äî schema presence inferred from observed model responses, but not explicitly documented in provided materials.

---

### Sub-Query 8 ‚Äî Provider Official Capability Docs
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo Vision ([docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o), [vision guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision))  
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet Vision ([docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview#claude-35-sonnet))  
- **Google**: Gemini Vision ([docs](https://ai.google.dev/docs/models/gemini); [multimodal prompts](https://ai.google.dev/docs/multimodal_prompts))  
- **Consensus**: All providers **explicitly document image input support.**  
- **Confidence**: High.

---

### Sub-Query 9 ‚Äî Customizing Fallback Behavior
- **Consensus**: OpenRouter supports flexible **routing**, but lacks declarative fallback for modality.  
- **Details**:  
  - Users can implement ‚Äúaliases‚Äù or ‚Äúpresets‚Äù to simulate fallback chains.  
  - Modality-aware fallback **must be implemented client-side**.  
- **Confidence**: High for provider/model fallback; Low for modality-specific fallback.

## üìå Synthesized Research Answer (Integrated)

For designing **routing to vision-capable models in a research application with OpenRouter**:

1. **Dynamic Catalog Detection**  
   - Use OpenRouter‚Äôs `/models` endpoint ([docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs), [models catalog](https://openrouter.ai/models)) to programmatically retrieve models and their metadata.  
   - Check **`modalities`** (look for `"image"`) and **`supports_vision`** flags (if present).  
   - Vision-capable models currently documented:  
     - OpenAI **GPT-4o / GPT-4V** ([OpenAI Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o); [Vision Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision))  
     - Anthropic **Claude 3.x / Claude 3.5 Sonnet** ([Anthropic Docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview#claude-35-sonnet))  
     - Google **Gemini Pro Vision, Gemini 1.5 Pro** ([Google AI Docs](https://ai.google.dev/docs/models/gemini))

2. **Routing & Prioritization**
   - Implement **provider prioritization** using the `provider` field in metadata.  
   - Example policy: Prefer OpenAI ‚Üí Anthropic ‚Üí Google ‚Üí fallback open-source (Mistral/LLaVA/Qwen-VL).  
   - Use OpenRouter features like **Model Routing** and **Provider Routing** ([docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs)).

3. **Graceful Fallback**  
   - OpenRouter natively handles **fallback for provider/model outages**, but **not modality-specific fallbacks**.  
   - For vision ‚Üí text fallback, implement application-layer logic:  
     - If input includes images, attempt a vision-capable model.  
     - On failure (model missing or rejecting input), degrade gracefully by retrying with the best available text-only model.  

4. **Recommended Practices**  
   - Use prescriptive **model aliases** or **presets** to configure fallback sequences.  
   - Validate image inputs (size, MIME type) before routing.  
   - Cache model lists from `/models` periodically.  
   - Use **structured outputs** and **prompt caching** for consistency.  
   - Always confirm capabilities against **official provider capability docs** (see URLs above).

## ‚úÖ Final Confidence Assessment
- **Vision model detection via `/models`:** High  
- **Provider prioritization:** High  
- **Graceful fallback (availability):** High  
- **Graceful fallback (modality):** Medium (client-side only)  
- **JSON schema exactness:** Medium (observed but not fully doc-verified)  
- **Major model family vision support (OpenAI / Anthropic / Google):** High  

---

üìå **In sum:**  
OpenRouter exposes the necessary metadata (via `/models`) to detect vision-capable models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini), allows provider prioritization using its routing system, but requires **application-side logic** to degrade gracefully when vision modalities are unsupported. Official provider docs confirm multimodal capabilities, so a robust research workflow should combine OpenRouter‚Äôs routing with client-side checks and controlled fallbacks.
